Maybe The Night
Ben&Ben

I want to lay down by the fire with you
Where souls are glowing, ever warmer too
Your love surrounds me like a lullaby
Singing softly, you are mine, oh mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Moon has never glowed this color
Hearts have never been this close
I have never been more certain
I will love you 'til we're old


[Chorus]
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Stay together here

[Refrain]
We follow the pull of fate, into this moment
We follow the pull of fate, into this moment

[Pre-Chorus]
Moon has never glowed this color
Hearts have never been this close
I have never been more certain
I will love you 'til we're old

[Chorus]
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Stay together

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Maybe the night holds a little hope for us, dear
Maybe we might want to settle down, just be near
Stay together
Stay together
Here
